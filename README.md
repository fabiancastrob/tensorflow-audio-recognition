# About this project

Demonstration of Tensorflow.js and audio recognition capabilites.

## Usage

Open the file index.html in your browser and press the buttons left, right and noise to train the model. The idea is to record sounds that distinguish the direction of the slide for a lapse of 3-4 seconds each button. Once you've finished recording, press the button test. You will see the accuracy of the model, and when finished, press the Listen button and make the corresponding sounds to see the slider move.
